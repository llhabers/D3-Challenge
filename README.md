# D3-Challenge
The project aims to understand health risks facing particular demographics by examining information from the U.S. Census Bureau and creating visualizations using D3.

## Situation
I was tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings. I will look into Healthcare vs. Poverty using data from the Census.

## Task
Using the D3 techniques we taught you in class, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. You'll code this graphic in the app.js file of your homework directoryâ€”make sure you pull in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. Your scatter plot should ultimately appear like the image at the top of this section.


1. Include state abbreviations in the circles.<br>
2. Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.<br>

## Action
Using the D3 techniques, I created a scatter plot between two of the data variables; Lack of Healthcare vs. In Poverty. Each circle elements representing each state. This graphic is coded in the app.js file with data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. The scatter plot appears like the image below:
